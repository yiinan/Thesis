# Thesis
a mobile AR prototype made by ARKit and Unity.
- Unity version 2017.3.1f1
- ARKit 1.5
- iPhone X with system IOS 11.3(beta)

This research mainly focus on Djurgården, an island in Stockholm. 
The island is mainly known for Skansen and Gröna Lund, however, it is a big island and there are other places worth exploring on the island. So this project aims to create a MAR prototype and to test if augmented reality can help tourists enjoy their trip.

Four places from the island were chosen. The four places were: 
- Visit Djurgården (visitor centre)
- The blue gate
- Lusthusportens park
- An equestrian statue 

Different AR content was designed for each place.
